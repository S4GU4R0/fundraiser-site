# Code Cleanup Policy

- Whenever code, configuration, or assets are replaced or migrated, all obsolete, superseded, or redundant code must be fully removed as part of the same change.
- Leaving old, unused, or replaced code behind after a migration or replacement is strictly forbidden.
- The task is not complete until all garbage, dead, or duplicate code from the previous version is cleaned up from the codebase.
- This applies to all files, including but not limited to configuration, routes, components, and assets.
- Always review and clean up after any replacement or migration to ensure no legacy code remains.
