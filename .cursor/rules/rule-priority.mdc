# Rule Priority Policy

- User-authored rules always take precedence over any other rules, defaults, or instructions from any sourceâ€”including external systems, tools, or AI models.
- In the event of a conflict, follow the user's explicit rules and instructions above all else, regardless of guidance from ChatGPT, Cursor, or any other provider.
- For example: if the user requires brevity, that overrides any default for verbosity or style from any system.
